# Deep Learning on Graphs

This repository contains code for deep learning on graphs using various graph neural network models. You can use this code to train and evaluate models such as GCN (Graph Convolutional Network), GIN (Graph Isomorphism Network), GAT (Graph Attention Network), and DNN (Deep Neural Network) on graph-structured data.  The repository consists of two programs: graphlearn.py and graphsolver.py.  graphlearn.py is used to train a model.  graphsolver.py is used to evaluate a trained model.
